        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I Love reading, it helps me relaxe and calm down. Whenever i am unhappy or stressed I can just read a book!
           <br/><br/>Reading also has many benefits. Reading for pleasure has been linked to increased cognitive progress in vocabulary and mathematics during adolescence. 
           Sustained high volume lifetime reading has been associated with high levels of academic attainment.

           Reading has also been shown to improve stress management, memory, focus, writing skills, and imagination.

           The cognitive benefits of reading continue into mid-life and the senior years.

           Reading books and writing are among brain-stimulating activities shown to slow down cognitive decline in seniors.</p>
